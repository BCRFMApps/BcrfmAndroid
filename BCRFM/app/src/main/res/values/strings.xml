    <string name="hello">BCRfm is a not-for-profit community radio station to serve Ballina and its outskirts.

        We are a voice for the community, run by the community.

        A dedicated committee of young and old who are passionate about radio and

        the place they call home.  We want to renew the vibrancy of Ballina and showcase what

        it and its outskirts has to offer.

        \n

        \n<b>Send Us Your Music!</b>
        \n
        \nBCRfm loves music and we aim to get as much great and varied music on the airwaves as possible.

        BCRfm is committed to showcasing music from Irish composers, singer songwriters and local bands across the programme schedule, with emphasis on those who would not yet have reached national fame.

        We will regularly feature demo discs from local groups, individual artists and have a one hour weekly programme dedicated to local bands and musicians.

        Local bands, choirs both adult and childrenâ€™s will on occasion play live in the studio.
        We are happy to air recorded music, live sessions, gig recordings or interviews, feel free to get in touch.
